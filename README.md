Below are some key points related to execution.

Automated : http://automationpractice.com/index.php
Added this code in the existing repository due my Eclipse connectivity issue.

# As runtime driver calling is taking more time in my machine so I explicitly called the local Chrom driver path. 
# Used TestNG framework with BDD
# Due to less time, few assertions were not added.
# Test cases are running properly as per assessment
# Used few reporting structure as I had setup in my MAC.

# This GIT repository is private and please let me know whom to add it to view this.
